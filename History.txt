====== History ======
Created Tuesday 05 September 2017

The history of the Eri'i began approximately 700 years before the rise of [[Important People:Arxis Quasar|Arxis Quasar.]]

The Eri'i was first settled by a medley of peoples who had originally settled the region around Gultsiev, known as the Throat of the World for the whistling winds created between the mountains. Emboldened by their success at taming the wild of the region, some inhabitants set about travelling north for more homesteading. Settlement of the permafrost terrain was slowgoing, but ultimately triumphed. 

The assiduous migrants innovated a system of farming that began with a few-year process of thawing and fertilizing the fields with manure, slurried seafood, composted tundra soil and water from nearby rivers and lakes. Farms kept huge stores of crops. Eventually, a political system emerged, wherein city states, usually along rivers or lakes, governed the more inland farms, who traded with the townfolk for imports from the south in exchange for their food.

Farming families usually had plenty of time to do things other than maintaining their fields. Skygazing became an especially popular and eventually spiritual activity. People following spellcasting traditions from the south eventually abandoned their practices in favour of drawing power from the stars. People found their places under the stars. Those from the farms based their lives around reverence of the sky. Those from the towns found more fulfillment in the Earth. Casters moving from the farms to the cities founded observatories and formed their own special, balanced place in this new caste system. They became the Krosine, the astronomers. The Krosine eventually became political elders of the cities, and evolved new elective traditions to decide their leaders. The concept of the Arcons/Arxi came from this evolution.
