====== Castes ======
Created Sunday 25 June 2017

* Castes are organized into a bipolar system.
* One direction of the spectrum is focused on knowledge.
* The other direction of the spectrum is focused on wisdom.
* [[.\Astronomer.txt|Astronomers]] are the middle caste.
* Anybody can enter the astronomer caste, but a special test is required for this, that almost all people can't pass.
* Cities have councils of astronomers that elect the political leader, an Imperator or Imperatrix, the perfect balance of the spectrum in one person and the apex of the caste system.
* Castes (aside from the astronomer and philosopher caste) tend to be focused on bloodlines, with families practicing the same traditions for generations.
* Separated by city rungs
