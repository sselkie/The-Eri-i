====== Castes ======
Created Sunday 25 June 2017

* Castes are organized into a bipolar system.
* One direction of the spectrum is focused on knowledge.
* The other direction of the spectrum is focused on wisdom.
* [[+Krosine|Astronomers]] are the middle caste.
* Anybody can enter the astronomer caste, but a special test is required for this, that almost all people can't pass.
* Cities have councils of astronomers that elect the political leader, an Arcon (male) or Arxis (female), the perfect balance of the spectrum in one person and the apex of the caste system.
* Castes (aside from the astronomer and philosopher castes) tend to be focused on bloodlines, with families practicing the same traditions for generations.
* Separated by city rungs
* The higher castes place more faith in the earth than the sky, and the lower castes place more faith in the sky than the earth
